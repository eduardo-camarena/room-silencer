## Description
This is the same old to-do app every engineer creates when they're learning a new framework, with some quality of life improvements, for one there is probably a better design than most to-do apps (kind of, I'm not a great with designing UI, but I'm good at implementing them I sware), also the data will be saved to localstorage since I also plan on using this app on my day-to-day. Other than that it's the good'ol to-do app.
